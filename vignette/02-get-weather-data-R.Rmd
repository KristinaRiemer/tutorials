# Objective: To be able to demonstrate how to get TERRA REF meteorological data

This vignette shows how to read weather data for the month of January 2017 from 
the [weather station](https://cals-mac.arizona.edu/weather-station) at the 
University of Arizona's [Maricopa Agricultural Center](http://cals-mac.arizona.edu/) 
into R. These data are stored online on the data management system Clowder, 
which is accessed using an API. Data across time for two of the weather 
variables, temperature and precipitation, are plotted in R. Lastly, how to get 
the list of all possible weather variables is demonstrated. 

### The structure of the database

The meteorological data that is collected for the TERRA REF project is contained 
in multiple related tables, also know as a [relational database](https://datacarpentry.org/sql-socialsci/01-relational-database/index.html). 
The first table contains data about the sensor that is collecting data. This is 
then linked to a stream table, which contains information about a datastream 
from the sensor. Sensors can have multiple datastreams. The actual weather data 
is in the third table, the datapoint table. A visual representation of this 
structure is shown below.

In this vignette, we will be using data from a weather station at the Maricopa 
Agricultural Center, with datapoints for the month of January 2017 from a 
certain sensor. These data are five minute summaries aggregated from 
observations taken every second. 


### Creating the URL for the API

In order to access the data, we need to contruct a URL that links to where the 
data is located on [Clowder](https://clowder.ncsa.illinois.edu/). The data is 
then pulled down using the API, which ["receives requests and sends responses"](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/what-is-an-api-in-english-please-b880a3214a82)
, for Clowder. 

All URLs have the same beginning 
(https://terraref.ncsa.illinois.edu/clowder/api/geostreams/), 
then additional information is added for each type of data table as shown below. 

* Station: /sensors/sensor_name=[name]
* Sensor: /sensors/[sensor number]/streams
* Datapoints: /datapoints?stream_id=[datapoints number]&since=[start date]&until=[end date]

A certain time period can be specified for the datapoints. 

For example, below are the URLs for the particular data being used in this 
vignette. These can be pasted into a browser to see how the data is stored as 
text using JSON. 

* Station: https://terraref.ncsa.illinois.edu/clowder/api/geostreams/sensors?sensor_name=UA-MAC+AZMET+Weather+Station
* Sensor: https://terraref.ncsa.illinois.edu/clowder/api/geostreams/sensors/438/streams
* Datapoints: https://terraref.ncsa.illinois.edu/clowder/api/geostreams/datapoints?stream_id=46431&since=2017-01-02&until=2017-01-31

Possible sensor numbers for a station are found on the page for that station 
under "id:", and then datapoints numbers are found on the sensor page under 
"stream_id:".

### Download data using the command line

Data can be downloaded from Clowder using the command line program Curl. If the 
following is typed into the commmand line, it will download the datapoints data 
that we're interested in as a file which we have chosen to call `spectra.json`. 

```{sh eval=FALSE}
curl -o spectra.json -X GET https://terraref.ncsa.illinois.edu/clowder/api/geostreams/datapoints?stream_id=46431&since=2017-01-02&until=2017-01-31
```

### Read in data using R

```{r met-setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache = TRUE, message = FALSE)
```

The same data can be accessed with the URL using the R package `jsonlite`. We 
are calling that library along with several others that will be used to clean 
and plot the data. The data is read in by the `fromJSON` function as a dataframe 
that also has two nested dataframes, called `properties` and `geometries`. 

```{r met-geostream}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(jsonlite)
library(lubridate)

weather_all <- fromJSON('https://terraref.ncsa.illinois.edu/clowder/api/geostreams/datapoints?stream_id=46431&since=2017-01-02&until=2017-01-31', flatten = FALSE)
```

The `geometries` dataframe is then pulled out from these data, which contains
the datapoints from this stream. This is combined with a transformed version of 
the end of the time period from the stream. 

```{r met-datapoints}
weather_data <- weather_all$properties %>% 
  mutate(time = ymd_hms(weather_all$end_time))
```

The temperature data, which is five minute averages for the entire month of 
January 2017, is used to calculate the growing degree days for each day. Growing 
degree days is a measurement that is used to predict when certain plant 
developmental phases happen. This new dataframe will be used in the last 
vignette to synthesize the trait, weather, and image data. 

```{r met-GDD}
daily_values = weather_data %>% 
  mutate(date = as.Date(time), 
         air_temp_converted = air_temperature - 273.15) %>% 
  group_by(date) %>% 
  summarise(min_temp = min(air_temp_converted), 
            max_temp = max(air_temp_converted), 
            gdd = ifelse(sum(min_temp, max_temp) / 2 > 10, 
                         (max_temp + min_temp) / 2 - 10, 0))
```

### Plot data using R

The five minute summary weather variables in the `weather_data` dataframe can be 
plotted across time, as shown below for temperature and precipitation. 

```{r temp-plot}
theme_set(ggthemes::theme_few())
ggplot(data = weather_data) +
  geom_point(aes(x = time, y = air_temperature), size = 0.1) +
  labs(x = "Date", y = "Temperature (K)")
```

```{r precip-plot}
ggplot(data = weather_data) +
  geom_point(aes(x = time, y = precipitation_rate), size = 0.1) +
  labs(x = "Date", y = "Precipitation (kg/m2s)")
```

### Get all available weather variables

The weather variables that are available from these datapoints data are 
extracted below from the column names of the dataframe that we read in earlier. 
Any of these variables that are of interest can be analyzed and plotted. 

```{r variables-list}
cols = colnames(weather_data)
cols[!cols %in% c("source", "source_file", "time")]
```

You should now be able to find, get, and use weather data from the TERRA REF 
project via Clowder.
