## Searching for data

On the Welcome page there is a search option for trait and yield data. This tool allows users to search the entire collection of trait data for specific sites, citations, species, and traits.


### Download search results as as csv file from the web interface

* Point your browser to https://terraref.org/bety/
* login 
* enter "NDVI" in the search box
* on the next page you will see the results of this search 
  * if you want all of the data, including data that has not gone through QA/QC, make sure to check the 'include unchecked records' option
* in the upper right, you will see a button that will allow you to download the search results as a CSV file. Click it. Open the file in a text editor or spreadsheet program and review its contents.

Note that the web interface only provides a core set of data and limited meta-data. To access all of the data within BETYdb, it is necessary to search and merge multiple tables. More complex queries, such as those in the [Agronomic metadata](06-agronomic-metadata.Rmd).
