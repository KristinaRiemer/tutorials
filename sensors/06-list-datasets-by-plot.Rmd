# Generating file lists by plot

## Pre-requisites: 

* if you have not already done so, you will need to 1) sign up for the [beta user program](terraref.org/beta) and 2) sign up and be approved for access to the the [sensor data portal](terraref.ncsa.illinois.edu/clowder) in order to get the API key that will be used in this tutorial
described in this tutorial. 

The terrautils python package has a new `products` module that aids in connecting
plot boundaries stored within betydb with the file-based data products available
from the workbench or Globus.

## Getting started

After installing terrautils, you should be able to import the `products` module.
```{python eval=FALSE}
from terrautils.products import get_sensor_list, unique_sensor_names
from terrautils.products import get_file_listing, extract_file_paths
```

The `get_sensor_list` and `get_file_listing` functions both require the *connection*,
*url*, and *key* parameters. The *connection* can be 'None'. The *url* (called host in the
code) should be something like `https://terraref.ncsa.illinois.edu/clowder/`.
The *key* is a unique access key for the Clowder api.

## Getting the sensor list

The first thing to get is the sensor name. This can be retreived using the
`get_sensor_list` function. This function returns the full record which may
be useful in some cases but primarily includes sensor names that include
a plot id number. The utility function `unique_sensor_names` accpets the 
sensor list and provides a list of names suitable for use in the 
`get_file_listing` function.

```{python eval=FALSE}
sensors = get_sensor_list(None, url, key)
names = unique_sensor_names(sensors)
```

Names will now contain a list of sensor names available in the Clowder
geostreams API. The list of returned sensor names could be something like the 
following:

* IR Surface Temperature
* Thermal IR GeoTIFFs Datasets
* flirIrCamera Datasets

## Getting a list of files

The geostreams API can be used to get a list of datasets that overlap a
specific plot boundary and, optionally, limited by a time range. Iterating 
over the datasets allows the paths to all the files to be extracted.

```{python eval=FALSE}
sensor = 'Thermal IR GeoTIFFs Datasets'
sitename = 'MAC Field Scanner Season 1 Field Plot 101 W'
datasets = get_file_listing(None, url, key, sensor, sitename)
files = extract_file_paths(datasets)
```

Datasets can be further filtered using the *since* and *until* parameters
of `get_file_listing` with a date string.

```{python eval=FALSE}
dataset = get_file_listing(None, url, key, sensor, sitename, 
        since='2016-06-01', until='2016-06-10')
```


# Querying the API

The source files behind the data are available for downloading through the API. By executing a series
of requests against the API it's possible to determine the files of interest and then download them.

Each of the API URL's have the same beginning (https://terraref.ncsa.illinois.edu/clowder/api), 
followed by the data needed for a specific request. As we step through the process you will be able
to see how then end of the URL changes depending upon the reuqest.

Below is what the API looks like as a URL. Try pasting it into your browser.

https://terraref.ncsa.illinois.edu/clowder/api/geostreams/sensors?sensor_name=MAC Field Scanner Season 1 Field Plot 101 W

This will return data for the requested plot including its id. This id (or identifier) can then be used for 
additional queries against the API.

In the examples below we will be using **curl** on the command line to make our API calls. Since the
API is accessed through URLs, it's possible to use the URLs in software programs or with a programming language
to retrieve its data. 

## A Word of Caution

The names of variables in this section don't necessarily match the ones in the section 
above. This is unintentinoal and is due to the legacy behind each of these approaches. The
names are meaningful and consistent in their respective domains, but not between each other.

For example, the Clowder API's use of the term *SENSOR_NAME* is equivalent to *site_name* above.

## Finding plot ID

We can query the API to find the identifier associated with the name of a plot. For this example
we use the variable name of SENSOR_DATA to indicate the name of the plot.

``` {sh eval=FALSE}
SENSOR_NAME="MAC Field Scanner Season 1 Field Plot 101 W"
curl -o plot.json -X GET "https://terraref.ncsa.illinois.edu/clowder/api/geostreams/sensors?sensor_name=${SENSOR_NAME}"
```

This creates a file named *plot.json* containing the JSON object returned by the API. The JSON object has an 
'id' parameter. This ID parameter can be used to specify the correct data stream.

## Finding stream ID within a plot

Using the sensor ID returned in the JSON from the previous call and the id of a sensor returned previously to get
the stream id. The names of streams are are formatted as "<Sensor Group> Datasets (<Sensor ID>)".

``` {sh eval=FALSE}
SENSOR_ID=3355
STREAM_NAME="Thermal IR GeoTIFFs Datasets (${SENSOR_ID})"
curl -o stream.json -X GET "https://terraref.ncsa.illinois.edu/clowder/api/geostreams/streams?stream_name=${STREAM_NAME}"
```

A file named *stream.json* will be created containing the returned JSON object. This JSON object has an 'id' parameter that
contains the stream ID. You can use this ID parameter to get the datasets, and then datapoints, of interest.

## Listing Clowder dataset IDs for that plot & sensor stream

We now have a stream ID that we can use to list our datasets. The datasets in turn contain files of interest.

``` {sh eval=FALSE}
STREAM_ID=11586
curl -o datasets.json -X GET "https://terraref.ncsa.illinois.edu/clowder/api/geostreams/datapoints?stream_id=${STREAM_ID}"
```

After the call succeeds, a file named *datasets.json* is created containing the returned JSON onject. As part of the
JSON object there are one or more `properties` fields containing *source_dataset* parameters.

```{javascript eval=FALSE}
properties: {
    dataset_name: "Thermal IR GeoTIFFs - 2016-05-09__12-07-57-990",
    source_dataset: "https://terraref.ncsa.illinois.edu/clowder/datasets/59fc9e7d4f0c3383c73d2905"
},
```

The URL of each **source_dataset** can be used to view the dataset in Clowder.

The datasets can also be filtered by date. The following filters out datasets that are outside of the range of January 2, 2017 through June 20, 2017.

``` {sh eval=FALSE}
curl -o datasets.json -X GET "https://terraref.ncsa.illinois.edu/clowder/api/geostreams/datapoints?stream_id=${STREAM_ID}&since=2017-01-02&until=2017-06-10"
```

## Getting file paths from dataset

Now that we know what the dataset URLs are, we can use the URLs to query the API for file IDs in addition to their names and paths.

Note the the URL has changed from our previous examples now that we're using the URLs returned by the previous call.

``` {sh eval=FALSE}
SOURCE_DATASET="https://terraref.ncsa.illinois.edu/clowder/datasets/59fc9e7d4f0c3383c73d2905"
curl -o files.json -X GET "${SOURCE_DATASET}/files"
```

As before, we will have a file containing the returned JSON, named *files.json* in this case. The returned JSON consists of a list 
of the files in the dataset with their IDs, and other data if available:

``` {javascript eval=FALSE}
[
    {
        size: "346069",
        date-created: "Fri Nov 03 11:51:13 CDT 2017",
        id: "59fc9e814f0c3383c73d2962",
        filepath: "/home/clowder/sites/ua-mac/Level_1/ir_geotiff/2016-05-09/2016-05-09__12-07-57-990/ir_geotiff_L1_ua-mac_2016-05-09__12-07-57-990.png",
        contentType: "image/png",
        filename: "ir_geotiff_L1_ua-mac_2016-05-09__12-07-57-990.png"
    },
    {
        size: "1231298",
        date-created: "Fri Nov 03 11:51:16 CDT 2017",
        id: "59fc9e844f0c3383c73d2980",
        filepath: "/home/clowder/sites/ua-mac/Level_1/ir_geotiff/2016-05-09/2016-05-09__12-07-57-990/ir_geotiff_L1_ua-mac_2016-05-09__12-07-57-990.tif",
        contentType: "image/tiff",
        filename: "ir_geotiff_L1_ua-mac_2016-05-09__12-07-57-990.tif"
    }
]
```

## Retrieving the files

Given that a large number of files may be contained in a dataset, it may be desireable to automate the process of pulling down files
to the local system.

For each file to be retrieved, the unique file ID is needed on the URL.

``` {sh eval=FALSE}
FILE_NAME="ir_geotiff_L1_ua-mac_2016-05-09__12-07-57-990.tif"
FILE_ID=59fc9e844f0c3383c73d2980
curl -o "${FILE_NAME}" -X GET "https://terraref.ncsa.illinois.edu/clowder/api/files/${FILE_ID}"
```

This call will cause the server to return the contents of the file identified in the URL. This file is then stored locally in *ir_geotiff_L1_ua-mac_2016-05-09__12-07-57-990.tif*.
