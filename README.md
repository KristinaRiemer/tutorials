# Tutorials

## An introduction to the use of TERRA REF data and software

Many of these tutorials have complex dependencies. In addition, many datasets are very large. These tutorials use the National Data Service Labs Workbench (NDS Labs Workbench). The NDS Labs Workbench provides the following:

* Custom configured computing environments  
  * In principle, it is possible to use any docker container on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/explore/).
* To get started, see the [workbench/ndslabs_workbench_intro.html](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/terraref/tutorials/blob/master/workbench/ndslabs_workbench_intro.html) tutorial.
* This will set you up to begin tutorials found in the traits, sensors, and plantCV folders.

### Data Access

The first research-grade version of TERRA REF data products will be released in November 2019. 
Before that, we will make evaluation releases available: the alpha version was released in November 2016 and the beta version will be released in 2018.

To access data please fill out a quick [Beta User application](http://terraref.org/beta).
